# StoryHub Frontend
## About
This is a react learning project for me at Cefalo during Internship. This project is a simple blogging site where users can create account, login and post stories. It has other necessary functionalities too ( update/delete etc ). I have mostly used hooks + context in this project. Used yup and react-hook-form for validation purpose. Used react portal and mostly learned the necessary stuffs.
